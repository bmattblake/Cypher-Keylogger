# Keylogger

**DISCLAIMER:**

This keylogger was made for educational purposes only. I do not condone malicious useage of this keylogger.

**Note that [L CTRL + F12] is the only way to stop the keylogger once it is running.**

This is a basic keylogger. It capturs keystorkes and records them locally in a file ```keylog.txt```.

The script will then email ```keylog.txt``` to a specified emaail address.
