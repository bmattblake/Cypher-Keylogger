# Keylogger

**Note that [CTRL + F12] is the only way to stop the keylogger once it is running.**

This is a basic Keylogger. It capturs keystorkes, and records them in a file "keylog.txt"

The program keeps track of the time that the keylogger started and when it was topped. This time is only according to they system's local time.

You must have pyinput installed for this program to work. To install pynput, enter the following command in your terminal

```
pip install pynput
```
